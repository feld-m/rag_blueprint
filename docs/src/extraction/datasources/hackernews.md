# HackerNews Datasource Implementation

This document outlines the approach taken to implement the HackerNews datasource and highlights key decisions made during the process.

---

## Overview

The HackerNews datasource integration is designed to extract, parse, and manage content from the HackerNews API, following the guidelines given here:
https://feld-m.github.io/rag_blueprint/how_to/how_to_add_new_datasource/

Task 1(Implementation)

## Components

### 1. **Configuration**
- **File:** `configuration.py`
- **Purpose:** Defines the configuration for the HackerNews datasource, including API base URL, endpoint for top stories, and the maximum number of stories to fetch.
              The `stories_url` property dynamically constructs the full URL for fetching top stories, ensuring flexibility if the base URL or endpoint changes.

---

### 2. **Client**
- **File:** `client.py`
- **Purpose:** Implements a singleton factory to create a simple client instance for interacting with the HackerNews API. Since no secrets or authentication are required, the client only includes the base URL.

---

### 3. **Reader**
- **File:** `reader.py`
- **Purpose:** Fetches raw data from the HackerNews API asynchronously and yields only the `id`, `title`, and `url` of each story.
  - The `read_all_async` method uses `aiohttp` for efficient asynchronous HTTP requests.
  - Limits the number of stories fetched to the `max_stories` configuration to optimize performance.

---

### 4. **Parser**
- **File:** `parser.py`
- **Purpose:** Converts raw story data into structured `HackerNewsDocument` objects.
  - The parser extracts only the `id`, `title`, and `url` fields, along with a `datasource` identifier for metadata consistency.

---

### 5. **Document**
- **File:** `document.py`
- **Purpose:** Defines the `HackerNewsDocument` class, which extends the `BaseDocument` to represent structured HackerNews content.
  - No additional fields or methods were added, as the base implementation suffices for this use case.

---

### 6. **Manager**
- **File:** `manager.py`
- **Purpose:** Orchestrates the reader and parser components to manage the extraction and processing of HackerNews content.
  - The `BasicDatasourceManager` is reused to simplify the implementation, with the reader and parser factories providing the necessary components.

---

### 7. **Registration**
- **File:** `__init__.py`
- **Purpose:** Registers the HackerNews datasource configuration and manager with the global registries.Ensures the datasource is discoverable and usable within the broader system.

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Asynchronous Data Fetching:**
   - The use of `aiohttp` in the reader ensures efficient handling of API requests, especially when fetching multiple stories.

2. **Minimal Metadata Extraction:**
   - Only essential fields (`id`, `title`, `url`) are extracted to keep the implementation lightweight and focused.

3. **Reusability:**
   - The design leverages existing base classes (`BaseDocument`, `BaseReader`, `BaseParser`, `BasicDatasourceManager`) to minimize redundancy and ensure consistency.

4. **Scalability:**
   - The modular approach allows for easy extension or modification of individual components without impacting the overall system.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Add robust error handling for API failures or malformed responses.

2. **Additional Metadata:**
   - Extend the parser to include more metadata fields if required by future use cases.

3. **Caching:**
   - Implement caching in the reader to reduce redundant API calls for frequently accessed stories.

## Task 2 (Design): Cloud Deployment Strategy

### Overview

To enhance deployment and extensibility, the blueprint can be adapted for cloud deployment. This section outlines a high-level strategy for deploying the HackerNews datasource on the cloud, focusing on scalability, performance, and maintainability.

---

### Recommended Toolstack

1. **Cloud Provider:**
  - **GCP (Google Cloud Platform):**
    - Services: Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Monitoring.
  - **Alternative:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Azure, depending on organizational preferences.

2. **Orchestration Tools:**
  - **Kubernetes (GKE):** For container orchestration and scaling.
  - **Docker:** To containerize the application for portability.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - **CircleCI:** For building, testing, and deploying the application.
  - **Alternative:** Github Actions

4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  - **Terraform:** To define and provision cloud infrastructure.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - **Cloud Monitoring (GCP):** For monitoring and logging.

---

### High-Level Deployment Strategy

### Cloud Deployment Strategy (GCP Perspective)

1. **Containerization:**
  - Use Docker to containerize the application with a `Dockerfile` including all dependencies.

2. **Infrastructure Setup:**
  - Use Terraform to provision GCP resources:
    - GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for running the application.
    - Cloud Storage for logs
    - Cloud SQL/Bigquery for database needs.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Set up GitHub Actions/Circle CI to automate:
    - Building and testing the Docker image.
    - Deploying the image to Artifact Registry.
    - Deploying the application to GKE.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Integrate Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging for real-time insights and alerting.

5. **Security:**
  - Use IAM roles and policies to restrict resource access.
  - Enable HTTPS using managed SSL certificates in Cloud Load Balancing.

---

### Key Considerations

1. **Scalability:**
   - Ensure the application can handle increased traffic by using auto-scaling and load balancing.
   - Optimize the reader and parser components for high throughput.

2. **Performance:**
   - Minimize latency by caching frequently accessed data.
   - Use asynchronous processing to handle API calls efficiently.

3. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.
   - Monitor resource usage and scale down during low traffic periods.

## ## Task 2 (Design) Making the System More Modular

A well-architected system should be easy to extend and modify. This section outlines a proposal for refactoring the blueprint to improve modularity, flexibility, and ease of integration for new datasources.

---

### Proposed Changes

#### 1. **Abstract Common Logic into Shared Modules**
- **Current State:**
  - Each datasource implements its own configuration, reader, parser, and manager independently.
- **Proposed Change:**
  - Create shared base classes or utilities for common functionality, such as:
    - API interaction (e.g., HTTP client utilities for GET/POST requests).
    - Metadata extraction and transformation.
    - Error handling and retry logic.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Reduces code duplication across datasources.
  - Simplifies the implementation of new datasources by reusing shared logic.

#### 2. **Introduce a Plugin System for Datasources**
- **Current State:**
  - Datasources are registered manually in the `__init__.py` file.
- **Proposed Change:**
  - Implement a plugin-based architecture where new datasources can be dynamically discovered and registered.
  - Use a configuration file or environment variables to specify enabled datasources.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Makes it easier to add or remove datasources without modifying core code.
  - Improves maintainability by decoupling datasource-specific logic from the core system.

#### 3. **Standardize Data Extraction Methods**
- **Current State:**
  - Each datasource implements its own data extraction logic in the reader and parser.
- **Proposed Change:**
  - Define a standard interface for data extraction methods, including:
    - Fetching raw data.
    - Transforming raw data into structured documents.
  - Use dependency injection to provide datasource-specific implementations.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Ensures consistency across datasources.
  - Simplifies testing by allowing mock implementations to be injected.


---

### Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Modularity:**
   - By abstracting common logic and standardizing interfaces, the system becomes easier to extend and maintain.

2. **Faster Integration of New Datasources:**
   - A plugin-based architecture and reusable components reduce the effort required to add new datasources.

3. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - A microservices architecture allows the system to handle increased load more effectively.

4. **Future-Proof Design:**
   - The proposed changes ensure the system is flexible enough to accommodate future enhancements and evolving requirements.
