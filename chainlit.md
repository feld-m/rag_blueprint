## üîí Privacy Policy

Thank you for your interest in our AI demo tool. The protection of your personal data and transparency regarding its processing are very important to us. Below we inform you clearly and comprehensibly about which data is processed when you use our **AI demo tool based on the Mistral-NeMo open source model**, for what purposes this is done and what rights you have under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Responsible person and contact

**Responsible body**

Operator of the AI demo tool (hereinafter referred to as "we").

**Who are we?**

FELD M GmbH, located at Waltherstra√üe 23, 80337 Munich, Germany, and available at contact@feld-m.de , is responsible for data processing in accordance with the [General Data Protection Regulation.](https://dsgvo-gesetz.de/art-4-dsgvo/)

**Contact data protection officer:**

If you believe that the processing of your personal data by us violates data protection regulations, you can contact us at datenschutz@feld-m.de.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The authority responsible for us is the [Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision](https://www.lda.bayern.de/de/index.html). However, you can also contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence or workplace.

_(Note: The operator of this demonstration system and controller within the meaning of the GDPR is FELD M GmbH. Inputs are passed on from our system to the data processor Mistral AI as the provider of the LLM used for generating the answers. For more information, see ‚ÄúDisclosure to third parties‚Äù below)_

### What data is processed?

**No registration or login** is required to use the AI demo tool. We do not request any active personal data from you. However, the following data is processed for technical reasons and to improve the service:

- **User input (chat questions):** The questions or messages you enter in the chat are processed by the system to provide you with answers. This chat input may contain personal information if, for example, you mention names or other data in your question. We use the input exclusively to generate the answer requested by the user from the AI system (purpose: **provision of the chat function**). In addition, we reserve the right to save the questions entered **for analysis and improvement purposes**. This means that we can subsequently evaluate chat logs in order to improve the quality of the AI model and the answers.

- **Technical usage data (IP address):** Each time you access our AI demo tool, our server automatically collects technical connection data. This includes, in particular, the **IP address** of your device, the date/time of the request and, if applicable, the browser type and operating system. The IP address is required to enable delivery of the website and the chat function to your device (**purpose:** technical provision and IT security). We also use IP addresses to ensure the secure operation of our system (e.g. detection of attacks or misuse). This technical log data is **not** merged with your chat entries or used for marketing purposes - it is used exclusively for technical **security** and the **operation of** our non-commercial demonstration offer.

**No further data:** We **do not** collect any **other personal data**. In particular, we **do not use any tracking tools or analysis cookies**. The chatbot is used anonymously **and** no personal **profile information** is created.

_(Note: The system may use a temporary session (e.g. session cookie or ID) exclusively to enable connected chats during your visit. However, this session data does not contain any personal information and is deleted at the end of the session)._

### For what purposes and on what legal basis?

We process the aforementioned data **for a specific purpose** and in accordance with the principle of **data minimization** only insofar as this is necessary for the provision and improvement of the service:

- **Provision of the service:** Your chat input must be processed so that the AI model can understand and answer your question. The IP address must also be processed so that our server can send the answer to your device. This processing is necessary in order to be able to provide the service you have requested (the chat response). The legal basis for this is** Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR** (legitimate interest). Our legitimate interest lies in the **functionality** of the AI demo tool and responding to your inquiries.

- **Analysis and improvement:** We have a legitimate interest in continuously improving our AI system and evaluating its performance. For this purpose, we can subsequently analyze your anonymized chat questions. The legal basis for storing and analyzing user input for improvement purposes is also **Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR**. Our legitimate interest here lies in the **further development of** the AI model and quality assurance, particularly as the service is operated purely for demonstration and research purposes. (Note: Should we intend to evaluate your chat entries in a personalized manner in the future or assign them to a specific user, we would first obtain your express consent. However, **no individualized evaluation** is currently taking place).

- **IT security and prevention of misuse:** The IP address is processed and log files are kept on the basis of **Article 6(1)(f) GDPR**. Our legitimate interest here is to ensure the security of our systems and to defend against attacks. Without temporary storage of the IP address, we would not be able to detect DDoS attacks, for example, or trace logical errors in system operation.

**Balancing of Interests:**

In the cases above, where the legal basis for processing is a legitimate interest, we have carried out a balancing of interests assessment, taking into account our interests in running, improving and securing our demo tool and systems on the one side and the users‚Äô interests, fundamental rights and privacy expectations on the other.

We have carefully considered the potential impact of our data processing activities on your privacy. Our analysis indicates that the benefits of providing a functional and improved AI demo system, which enhances user experience and contributes to research and development in AI technology, outweigh the potential risks to your privacy.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data and minimize any risks associated with its processing. This includes retaining personal data only as long as necessary (see ‚ÄúStorage period and deletion‚Äù below) and deleting or anonymizing it afterwards and also ensuring that any data retained for analysis is handled securely and in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

Should you have any concerns regarding our processing activities or wish to exercise your rights under the GDPR, please do not hesitate to contact us via datenschutz@feld-m.de.

### Disclosure to third parties

We are using La Plateforme by Mistral AI for running this demo tool. Please note that your chat inputs will be forwarded to Mistral AI through API calls, as they are hosting the language model (LLM) used for our tool. This data will be transmitted exclusively from our infrastructure, ensuring that there is no direct connection between the client (your browser/device) and Mistral AI infrastructure. As a result, your IP addresses or user agent information will not be disclosed to Mistral. Only the chat prompts you enter will be shared with them.

The improvement of the model and Mistral services based on the API calls has been deactivated, ensuring that your data will not be used for model training purposes. Mistral will retain the Inputs and Outputs for the period necessary to generate the Output and then for 30 rolling days to monitor abuse. Fine-tuning and feedback data will be retained until it is deleted.

We have concluded a data-processing agreement with Mistral AI pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.

For more information about the processing of data by Mistral AI, we would like to refer you to: https://mistral.ai/terms#privacy-policy

_(Note: In exceptional cases, we may be legally obliged to transfer data to authorities - for example, by order of the authorities. However, this would only take place within the framework of the applicable laws and in compliance with your rights)._

### Storage period and deletion

We only store personal data for as long as is necessary for the respective purposes:

- **Server log data (incl. IP addresses):** These are only stored for a limited period of time. IP addresses in our technical logs are **automatically deleted after 30 days**. Longer storage only takes place if a security incident (e.g. an attack) needs to be analyzed. In such cases, the relevant log extracts are stored until the incident has been clarified and then deleted.

- **Chat entries:** We may save the content of the chats (questions and answers given by the AI) for testing and improvement purposes. The raw data of the chat entries are either deleted or made unrecognizable by anonymization **after 30 days from the end of the chat session**. We may retain aggregated or anonymized findings (without personal reference) for longer, as they no longer fall under the GDPR.

- **No permanent storage beyond this:** No user accounts are created and no individual user data is archived beyond the purposes mentioned. When you leave the chat, **no personal data** remains permanently in our system, except for the temporarily stored logs as described above.

### Your rights as a data subject

As a user of our AI demo tool, you have the following **rights** with regard to the processing of your personal data. You can assert these rights informally at any time using the contact details above:

- **Right to information (Art. 15 GDPR):** You have the right to obtain information about which of your personal data we process. Upon request to , we will be happy to inform you which of your personal data we have stored and for what purposes it is processed.

- **Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR):** If the personal data you have entered (e.g. if you have accidentally misspelled a name) is incorrect or incomplete and is still stored in our systems, you can request that this data be corrected.

- **Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR):** You can request that we erase your personal data. Please note that we only store personal user data for a very short time as described above. However, if we still have your data, we will comply with your request for erasure without undue delay, provided that there are no statutory retention obligations to the contrary.

- **Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR):** In certain circumstances (e.g. if the accuracy of the data is disputed), you can request the restriction of the processing of your data. In such a case, we will mark the data concerned and only process it for strictly limited purposes.

- **Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR):** You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data if this is based on legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). In this case, we will cease the processing in question unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that outweigh your interests. Example: If you do not want your (pseudonymized) chat questions to be used for analysis purposes, you can object to this and we will then no longer take this data into account.

- **Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR):** Where applicable, you have the right to receive the data that you have provided to us (e.g. your chat entries) in a commonly used, machine-readable format or - at your request, where technically feasible - to have it transferred to a third party. Note: As our service is used anonymously and without an account, as a rule hardly any formatted data is covered by this right; however, you can contact us about this.

- **Right to lodge a complaint:** If you are of the opinion that the processing of your personal data by us violates data protection law, you can lodge a complaint with the responsible **data protection supervisory authority**. The competent authority is, for example, the data protection officer of your federal state or our company headquarters.

_(Note: To exercise your rights or if you have any questions, you can contact us at any time using the contact details provided above. As we work without a user account, please provide information that makes it easier for us to find any data (e.g. the IP address used and the date/time of your use) if you would like information or deletion. If, despite careful storage, we are unable to identify your data, we will inform you accordingly)._

### Data security

We take appropriate **technical and organizational measures** to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss or misuse. Communication with the AI demo tool takes place via an **encrypted connection (HTTPS)** so that your entries are transmitted securely. Our servers are firewall-protected and are regularly updated to close security gaps. Access to stored log data is restricted to authorized administrators. In addition, data collected for demonstration and improvement purposes is _anonymized or deleted after 30 days_, as described in this statement. We regularly review our security measures and adapt them to the state of the art in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

Please note that the interaction with the AI chatbot is automated. This means that you will receive answers from an artificial intelligence and not from a human employee. This automated processing of your request is solely for the information purpose you have requested. There is **no automated decision-making, including profiling, within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR** that has legal effects or similarly significant adverse effects for you. (The chatbot only provides information on Bundestag topics; no other decisions are made about you).

### Data protection impact assessment

We have evaluated whether a data protection impact assessment within the meaning of Art. 35 GDPR is required. Given the limited scope of personal data being processed as part of this demonstration tool as well as taking into account the implemented measures for data security and limitation to the described specific purposes, we conclude the processing will not likely result in a high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Therefore we determined that conducting a data protection impact assessment not being necessary.
